# Quick TOC - A Floating Table of Contents Chrome Extension

## Why Quick TOC?

When reading long articles or documentation online, I often find myself scrolling up and down to navigate through the content. I've always preferred having a floating table of contents (TOC) that's always visible, making it easy to jump between sections.

Unfortunately, many websites don't offer this feature. While there are existing Chrome extensions that provide this functionality, I'm cautious about installing third-party extensions due to privacy and security concerns. Given that the functionality I needed was relatively simple, I decided to create my own.

## AI-Powered Development

This extension was created with the help of AI. I used Google Gemini 2.5 Pro to generate:

*   All of the source code for the extension.
*   The logo.
*   The extension's description and promotional materials.

The code in this repository is almost entirely AI-generated, with minimal manual intervention. This project demonstrates how powerful AI can be in simplifying software development.

## How to Use

The published version of this extension on the Chrome Web Store uses the exact same code you see in this repository.

If you share my desire for a floating TOC but are hesitant to trust extensions built by others, you have a couple of options:

1.  **Build Your Own with AI:** You can use an AI assistant, like I did, to generate your own version of this extension.
2.  **Use This Code Directly:** You can review the code in this repository for yourself. Once you're comfortable, you can load it as an unpacked extension in Chrome.

### Loading as an Unpacked Extension

1.  Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2.  Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3.  Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
4.  Click on "Load unpacked".
5.  Select the directory where you cloned or downloaded this repository.

The Quick TOC extension should now be installed and ready to use.
